# The-M.T.H.R
The mthr is a temperature and relative humidity mesurement.
# The SHTC3
The shtc3 is the temperature and relative humidity sensor used in this mini-project.
It is capable of measuring temperatures from -40°C to 125°C and humidities from 0 to 100%.
# Objectives
The main objective of this project is to design a real-time environmental monitoring solution using an SHTC3 and a Raspberry Pi board.
The system must be capable of measure ambient temperature and humidity, and display the measured data on a web page.
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a practical system for monitoring environmental conditions in a given area.
The data collected can be used to make decisions on adjustments to be made in a given environment, such as adding ventilation or air-conditioning, or to monitor ventilation or air-conditioning systems, or to monitor storage conditions for products
sensitive to humidity and temperature.
